## The Past  ##

...discuss...


## My Plan ##

I thought I'd progress carefully, making sure I *really* wanted to do this.
The plan was:

- Run linux in a virtual machine for a while
- Swap 


## Reality ##

Running most `GTK+` apps still--after all these years--fills the terminal
with warnings that all seem to be harmless.  I definietly remember that from
my old linux days.

Example from `VLC` just now, which is extra funny because the first line
looks like its from a QT class.

```
qt.qpa.xcb: QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 961, resource id: 10762333, major code: 40 (TranslateCoords), minor code: 0

(vlc:3792): Gtk-WARNING **: 14:57:40.495: Failed to measure available space: The specified location is not supported
```

## Random Observations ##

- All the random retro screensavers in *XScreenSaver* have been nice to see
  on my screen every time I return to it.
