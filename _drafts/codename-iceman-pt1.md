## Miscellaneous Observations ##

- Unlike many earlier Sierra games, typing "look" only tells you about
  the thing you are facing, if anything.  Older games would give you a
  general description of the room.
- I hoped there would be several game-ending deaths available during
  the CPR incident, but instead it just says "the manual tells you
  what to do."  That's not as fun!
- The many submarine driving/procedural episodes are not fun.  Adventure
  games are not arcade games.
- The many messages to decode are not fun.  It's tedious.

## Questions ##

- Why didn't I tell Braxton about the spy and earring and microfilm?
