I had so much fun in my last post simplifying *The Colonel's Bequest* that
I thought I would do somthing similar for my other SCI games. 

**As a reminder**: I don't really want to *bypass* the copy protection. I
like seeing it; it's a nostalgia thing.  I just don't want to have to get
the answer correct to get to the other side of it.

The patch I produced is at the bottom of this post.

## Getting Started

As before, I used the excellent [SCI Companion](http://scicompanion.com/)
software, rather than write my own decompiler--though I will probably do
that one day for fun.

To start, I decompiled all the game scripts, and searched through the text
for hints as to were the copy protection scheme was.  In this case, none
of the text resources were helpful, because the script had all the strings
baked in.  Fortunately, the script had a very obvious name: **copyProtect**.
It's room `701`.

## The Protection Scheme

The copy protection scheme is set up as follows:

~~~~~~
(switch (= local0 (Random 1 79))
  (1 (= local2 431))
     ... elided the rest ...
)
(switch local0
  (1
    (= local1
      {On page 2, what is the fourth word of the first sentence?}
    )
  )
      ... elided the rest ...
)
~~~~~~

So, `local0` has the random question's id, `local2` has a hash of the
correct answer, and `local1` has the question string. 
Let's see how they are used...
 
First, it calls a procedure to put up the dialog box, and place the
user input into an array `local3`:

~~~~~~
(proc255_0
  (Format @global300 701 0 local1)
  134
  7
  15
  66
  global23
  140
  290
  82
  @local3
  30
)
~~~~~~

Then, as an interesting aside: if `global215` is set, the user can
just type a room number to jump to.  At least, that's what it looks
like to me.  Debugging aid, I guess:

~~~~~~
(if
  (and global215 (= local33 (ReadNumber @local3)))
    (TheMenuBar draw:)
    (SL enable:)
    (self newRoom: local33)
    (return)
)
~~~~~~

Next, we get to the hashing section. It looks like `kernel_102` does
the heavy lifting, and the hash is accumulated in `local35`:

~~~~~~
(= local33 0)
(while (< local33 (StrLen @local3))
  (= local34
    (& (= local34 (kernel_102 @local3 local33)) $005f)
  )
  (kernel_102 @local3 local33 local34)
  (= local35 (+ local35 local34))
  (++ local33)
)
~~~~~~

That *might* be of interest, but I'm hoping I can just bypass the check
itself rather than manipulating the hash.  Here's the check, which holds
a fun surprise:

~~~~~~
(cond 
  ((not (StrCmp @local3 {BOBALU})) (global2 newRoom: 700))
  ((== local35 local2) (global2 newRoom: 700))
  (else (proc255_0 701 1) (= global4 1))
)
~~~~~~

Do you see the `BOBALU` string constant?  It looks like that just lets
you through regardless of the hash.  I tried it, and it works!  I'm sure
people knew about this, but it was news to me.  Ok, so then we check
the hash in the second line.  The third line is the failure case.

Perhaps, let's just change this entire `cond` expression into the
code for `(global2 newRoom: 700)`.  No check at all against what I
typed, then.  Here's the disassembly of that section:

  0a52:48               ret 
  0a53:00               bnot 
~~~~~~

I'm just going to take the `newRoom 700` part and follow it with a `ret`
instruction, and see what happens...

... and it works!  I can type whatever:

## The Patch

Just put [this script.701 patch](/assets/2020/02/script.701) as `script.701` in
your game directory, and it should work.

It's nice that this change is
specific to the copy protection script, because it gives some confidence that
the overall game isn't broken by the change I made.  Also, none of the original
game assets were modified.  That's the nice thing about the SCI engine... it
looks for uncompressed overrides of the in-game scripts on the file-system.  If
you delete the patch file (or rename it), the game will resume checking your
answer.
