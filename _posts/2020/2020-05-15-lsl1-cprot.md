I'm continuing my series of posts where I simplify the copy protection schemes
on my old Sierra games.  This entry is different in two ways.  First, this 
one is an AGI game: the original _Leisure Suit Larry_. Second, this isn't
a _copy_-protection, but rather an _age_-protection.  The game half-heartedly
attempts to make you prove you are old enough to play.

__As a reminder__: I don't really want to _bypass_ the copy protection. I
like seeing it; it's a nostalgia thing.  I just don't want to have to get
the answer correct to get to the other side of it.

A patch of my final solution is provided at the end of the article.

## Getting Started

As this is an AGI game, I'm using [my own disassembler](https://github.com/rwtodd/agi-tools).  By the way, in that repository is a Go version and a Clojure
version in different branches.  Soon there will be a Java version, because
I'm a little crazy.

Anyway, I am looking for the "How old are you?" quiz that the game
gives the player.  I want it to issue questions and tell you if you
are right or wrong, just like it always has... except I want it to
let you through to the game no matter what happens.

So, to get started, I extracted all the `logic` scrips.  Searching for
strings revealed that the quiz appears to be run in `logic.006`. 

## The Protection Scheme

The questions themselves appear to live in `logic.002` and `logic.003`, but
are called from `logic.006`.  Here's the relevant part, where it
grades your answer, in cleaned-up pseudocode:

~~~~~~
IF (answer was correct) {
   say "Correct";
   v95 = 5;
   v66 = 8;
} else if(this is the first wrong answer) {
   say "You blew that one"
   remember the loss (in flag 200);
   v95 = 2;
   v94--;
} else {
   say "You are a kid!";
   quit;
}
~~~~~~

... and here's the actual disassembly:

(__N.B.__: if you are accustomed to the SCI decompilations from my last
few posts, these will look extremely primitive. That's partly because the
AGI interpreter is much more primitive, and partly because this is more of
a disassembly than a decompilation).

~~~~~~
IF(  ;; FF
    OR(  ;; FC
        equalv(%v92, %v93) ;; 025C5D
        NOT(  ;; FD
            greatern(%v93, 0) ;; 055D00
        )  ;; (FD)
    )  ;; FC
) {  ;; FF
    set(%f15) ;; 0C0F
    ;; flg 15 = <'print'/'print_at'>
    print(%m8) ;; 6508
    ;; msg 8 = <Correct.>
    assignn(%v95, 5) ;; 035F05
    assignn(%v66, 8) ;; 034208
} else {
    IF(  ;; FF
        NOT(  ;; FD
            isset(%f200) ;; 07C8
        )  ;; (FD)
    ) {  ;; FF
        assignn(%v95, 2) ;; 035F02
        print(%m5) ;; 6505
        ;; msg 5 = <Oops. You blew that one! ... >
        set(%f200) ;; 0CC8
        decrement(%v94) ;; 025E
    } else {
         print(%m6) ;; 6506
         ;; msg 6 = <You're a kid!! ...>
         quit(1) ;; 8601
    }
}
~~~~~~

So immediately I can see the most important thing is __not__ to set flag 200.
That may even be enough.  There are differences in `v95`, `v66`, and
`v94` between the right and wrong paths, too, which I can smooth over if
I need to. 

## Attempt One

So, let's just avoid setting flag 200.  Setting a flag is opcode `0x0C`, while
resetting a flag is `0x0D`.  We'll just reset the flag instead of setting it.
I find the opcodes above in `VOL.1`, and adjust it:

... and it kind-of works, but it keeps asking question-after-question as you
get them wrong.

## Attempt Two
So much for the minimal adjustment!  Now let's change all the variables so
they match the correct-answer path.  __Of course__ it would be easier to
just force the game to think all the answers are correct, but I'd rather
get the right feedback from the game as I go. 

So, this time I set `v66` and `v95` just like the correct-answer path.
This byte sequence is 1-byte shorter than it was before, so I pull the
`FE 04` unconditional jump over one and update the distance to `05`.

... and it works!  I can get as many wrong as I want, and it just keeps
giving me credit despite warning me not to miss another one.

## Patch

Unfortunately AGI games don't look for out-of-band patches like SCI games
do.  So, I had to patch `VOL.1` directly.  Here is an IPS patch file
for it: [vol1.ips](/assets/2020/04/vol1.ips).  There is IPS patching
software all over the internet (like [here](https://zerosoft.zophar.net/)).

Alternatively, you can just use a hex-editor and patch the file as shown
in the screenhot above.  Or you can just concentrate and answer the
questions correctly!
