I'm continuing my series of posts where I patch old Sierra games to
simplify their copy-protection tasks.  Today, it's the *little black book*
challenge to get into LSL2.  If it's like the other games so far, I don't
expect it to be terribly difficult, but we'll see!

**As a reminder**: I don't really want to _bypass_ the copy protection. I
like seeing it; it's a nostalgia thing.  I just don't want to have to get
the answer correct to get to the other side of it.

The patch I produced is at the bottom of this post.

## Getting Started

As before, I used the excellent [SCI Companion](http://scicompanion.com/)
software, rather than write my own decompiler--though I will probably do
that one day for fun.

To start, I decompiled all the game scripts, and searched through the text
for hints as to were the copy protection scheme was.  It turns up as text number 10.

![text for room 10 screenshot](/assets/2020/05/text-010.png)

... which means we need to look at the script for room 10.

## The Protection Scheme

The copy protection scheme is very similar to the other games.  First, a random number
is generated to drive hard-coded question parameters and answer strings:

~~~~~~
(switch (= local0 (Random 1 16))
	(1
		(= local1 0)
		(= local2 5)
		(= local3 1)
		(= local4 4)
		(= local5 7)
		(= local6 {555-7448})
	)
	    ... elided the rest,,,
)
~~~~~~

Then, after displaying the question and collecting the user's input into `global170`,
it checks the answer:

~~~~~~
(cond 
	((not (StrCmp @global170 {555-0724})) (= global100 1) (global2 newRoom: 23))
	((not (StrCmp @global170 local6)) (global2 newRoom: 90))
	(else
		(proc255_0 10 3)
		(if local8 (proc255_0 10 4) else (= global4 1))
	)
)
~~~~~~

This is extremely similar to the *King's Quest IV* scheme, in that:

  - `global4` records whether the user got the correct answer.  Actually I think all of the
  SCI games used `global4` for this.
  - There is a hard-coded, always-correct answer of `555-0724`, which bypasses the intro and
  dumps you into the game.  This has to be to help playtesters or debuggers.

 
 So, just like *KQIV*, I'm going to just change the entire `cond` expression into a call
 to `(global2 newRoom: 90)`.  Here's the disassembly of that portion of the code:
 
 ~~~~~~
   058d:7a          push2 
  058e:5b 00 aa      lea 0 aa 
  0591:36           push 
  0592:72 0132     lofsa $06c7 // 555-0724
  0595:36           push 
  0596:43 49 04    callk StrCmp 4 

  0599:18            not 
  059a:30 0011       bnt code_05ae 
  059d:35 01         ldi 1 
  059f:a1 64         sag global100 
  05a1:38 00e4     pushi e4 // $e4 newRoom
  05a4:78          push1 
  05a5:39 17       pushi 17 // $17 name
  05a7:81 02         lag global2 
  05a9:4a 06        send 6 

  05ab:32 0039       jmp code_05e7 

        code_05ae
  05ae:7a          push2 
  05af:5b 00 aa      lea 0 aa 
  05b2:36           push 
  05b3:8b 06         lsl local6 
  05b5:43 49 04    callk StrCmp 4 

  05b8:18            not 
  05b9:30 000d       bnt code_05c9 
  05bc:38 00e4     pushi e4 // $e4 newRoom
  05bf:78          push1 
  05c0:39 5a       pushi 5a // $5a isKindOf
  05c2:81 02         lag global2 
  05c4:4a 06        send 6 

  05c6:32 001e       jmp code_05e7 

        code_05c9
  05c9:7a          push2 
  05ca:39 0a       pushi a // $a nsLeft
  05cc:39 03       pushi 3 // $3 y
  05ce:47 ff 00 04 calle ff procedure_0000 4 // proc255_0 

  05d2:83 08         lal local8 
  05d4:30 000c       bnt code_05e3 
  05d7:7a          push2 
  05d8:39 0a       pushi a // $a nsLeft
  05da:39 04       pushi 4 // $4 x
  05dc:47 ff 00 04 calle ff procedure_0000 4 // proc255_0 

  05e0:32 0004       jmp code_05e7 

        code_05e3
  05e3:35 01         ldi 1 
  05e5:a1 04         sag global4 

        code_05e7
  05e7:48            ret 
 ~~~~~~
 
 ... so I just copied the code for the call followed by a `RET` (`0x48`) into that spot:

 ... and it works!  I can type anything in now, and it lets me through:

## The Patch

Just put [this script.010 patch](/assets/2020/05/script.010) as `script.010` in
your game directory, and it should work.

It's nice that this change is
specific to the copy protection script, because it gives some confidence that
the overall game isn't broken by the change I made.  Also, none of the original
game assets were modified.  That's the nice thing about the SCI engine... it
looks for uncompressed overrides of the in-game scripts on the file-system.  If
you delete the patch file (or rename it), the game will resume checking your
answer.
