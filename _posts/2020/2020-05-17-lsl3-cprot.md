title: "Simplifying \"Leisure Suit Larry 3\"'s Age Protection"

I'm continuing my series of posts where I patch old Sierra games to
simplify their copy-protection tasks.  Today, it's the *age quiz*
challenge to pick a raunchiness-level in LSL3.  I expect this one to
be a little different than the other SCI games (maybe closer to LSL1).

**As a reminder**: I don't really want to *bypass* the age protection. I
like seeing it; it's a nostalgia thing.  I just don't want to have to get
the answer correct to get to the other side of it.

The patch I produced is at the bottom of this post.

## Getting Started ##

As before, I used the excellent [SCI Companion](http://scicompanion.com/)
software, rather than write my own decompiler--though I will probably do
that one day for fun.

To start, I decompiled all the game scripts, and searched through the text
for hints as to were the copy protection scheme was.  Before long I spot the lists
of questions in texts 141 to 160 or so.  Also, it jumps out right away that the
correct answer is encoded with the question:

![text for a question set](/assets/2020/06/text-151.png)

You can see that a number precedes the questions, indicating which
answer is correct.  The code for the game obviously strips that off
before displaying it.

`Text 140` has the actual control logic, based on the texts:

![text for room 140](/assets/2020/06/text-140.png)

So, next I'll check out `Script.140`...

## The Protection Scheme ##

As with my `LSL1` patch, I want the game to tell me if I get the questions right or wrong, 
but then give me credit anyway.  So, that's the angle I'll be looking for as I inspect the
code.

Right away, I know it will be slower going this time because the decompiler failed on a large
part of this script.  So, I'll have to slog through plain disassembly instead.  Just skimming
through the file, I note a few things right away:

  - This code reads and/or writes to two different files, going by the
    names of calls like `FOpen`.
    - `LARRY3.DRV` appears to hold 3 pseudorandom numbers. Maybe their
      purpose is to keep from giving out the same questions twice in a
      row?  I'm not sure.
    - `RESOURCE.LL3` has a number in it, which might be related to the
    ultimate raunchiness level you attain.  Maybe it will become clear
    during this investigation.  (*EDIT*: Yep, `Room 290` reads this
    file right after `Room 140` writes it out, and stores the number
    in `global124`, which I can see is what the game tests for
    raunchiness level.  Maybe the testers would keep a read-only file
    with the number they wanted to achieve in it?  I don't know.)
  - It looks like maybe `local2` will ultimately hold your
  score... this code jumped out at me, since it keep comparing
  `local2` to numbers and assigning the level strings based on them:
  
~~~~~
    pushi    11
    lsl      local2
    dup     
    dup     
    ldi      5
    eq?     
    bnt      code_05f4
    lofsa    {Totally Raunchiest}
    jmp      code_061e
code_05f4:
    dup     
    ldi      4
    eq?     
    bnt      code_0601
    lofsa    {Really Filthy}
    jmp      code_061e
code_0601:
    dup     
    ldi      3
    eq?     
    bnt      code_060e
    lofsa    {Pretty Dirty}
    ...etc...
~~~~~

So, with that clue, let's see what else happens with `local2`... next up, they 
subtract 1 from it and write it to a file named `RESOURCE.LL3`.  It looks like maybe
they skip writing to the file if you had scored 0 (leading to 0-1 = 65535 in 16-bit unsigned
arithmetic)?  That's interesting:

~~~~~~
    lsl      local2
    ldi      1
    sub     
    sag      global124
    pushi    2
    lofsa    {RESOURCE.LL3}
    push    
    pushi    2
    callk    FOpen,  4
    sat      temp2
    push    
    ldi      65535
    ne?     
    bnt      code_068f
    pushi    4
    lea      @temp3
    push    
    pushi    140
    pushi    12
    lsg      global124
    callk    Format,  8
    pushi    2
    lst      temp2
    lea      @temp3
    push    
    callk    FPuts,  4
code_068f:
    pushi    1
    lst      temp2
    callk    FClose,  2
~~~~~~

Still looking for `local2` references, I find the part of the code which checks your answer.
Being disassembly rather than a decompilation, it's rather long, so I'll summarize first:

~~~~~~
if (local5 == local6) {
   // right answer
   say "Correct" (message 9)
   play "Correct" music
   increase local2   (right answer count)
   increase local3   (which picture to show)
} else {
   // wrong answer
   say "Wrong" (message 10)
   play "Wrong" music
   decrease local3 if it's not 0
}
show the new picture 
   (she has fewer clothes the higher local3 gets)
~~~~~~

... and here's the bytecode for all that:

~~~~~~
    lsl      local5
    lal      local6
    eq?     
    bnt      code_055b

## Now to Patch It ##

So, having learned everything we need to know, I plan to patch that last code snippet
such that:

  - it still tells me if I'm correct or not
  - the accounting in local2 and local3 will adjust as if I were correct every time
  
That means just changing the `lal local3; bnt 0594; -al local3` sequence into
a `+al local2; +al local3` like the correct path had.  I get SCI Companion to give me
the raw disassembly with the bytecodes next to it, so I know what byte sequence to copy. And,
thankfully, there is enough room to avoid changing the size of the overall code.

I had 3 bytes left to fill with some kind of no-op, so I tried `32 00 00` (an unconditional
jump of 0 bytes)... and hoped for the best!  ScummVM did not choke on it, and neither did
DOSBox when running the actual Sierra interpreter, so I think I'm in the clear.

More importantly, it worked!  I answered every question wrong, but the clothes kept coming
off the picture on the left, and then it told me I could play at the most adult level:

## The Patch ##

Just put [this script.140 patch](/assets/2020/06/script.140) as `script.140` in
your game directory, and it should work.

It's nice that this change is
specific to the copy protection script, because it gives some confidence that
the overall game isn't broken by the change I made.  Also, none of the original
game assets were modified.  That's the nice thing about the SCI engine... it
looks for uncompressed overrides of the in-game scripts on the file-system.  If
you delete the patch file (or rename it), the game will resume checking your
answers.
