It's occasionally very frustrating when new versions of tools don't offer the
same capabilities as their predecessors.  Today, I give you the ordered-list
options in *OneNote2016* vs *OneNote UWP*:

That's just embarrassing.  The whole point of the product is to take notes, and
options for different outline headings would seem to be a basic feature. 

However, it's not as bad as it looks.  It occured to me that the new version can still
successfully edit old outlines,
so the capability to understand all the heading options must be there.  Upon investigation,
it turns out that you can just type the heading you want, and the UWP version will turn it
into that type of list.

I guess that's better than nothing, but *features should be discoverable*! I'm glad
Microsoft has decided to keep working on *OneNote2016* after all.  They need to drop
the toy platform and focus on what worked.  The PC didn't change when mobile hit--right or wrong--
so it doesn't need a dumbed-down mobile interface.  Most power users still spend a lot of time in a
TTY emulator, and they like it that way.  Let's just refine what was there.  At the end of the
day, you can't design a revolution.  If the PC radically changes, it's going to happen by
chance and unexpectedly (think: the WWW), not in a boardroom where people sit around thinking "how 
can we make Windows more like my iPhone?"
